1. What was the most challenging part of planning or coding?
The hardest part was figuring out the order of the questions the program ask itself.
 I had to make sure the program looked at invalid withdrawals first, then checked if the amount was bigger than the balance.
 It took a little thinking, but it got easier once I went step by step.

2. How did the trace table help identify errors before coding?
The trace table helped a lot because I could test different situations on paper before running the program.
It showed me clearly what the program should do when the withdrawal was negative, zero, bigger than the balance, or exactly equal to the balance.
This made it easier to see if I missed any cases.
It also saved me time because I didnâ€™t have to run the code over and over again just to test every possibility.

3. How would you explain your solution to a friend new to programming?
I would say the program just looks at the numbers step by step. First it asks for the balance and the withdrawal amount. 
Then it sees if the withdrawal is invalid or bigger than the balance, and shows an error if it is.
If everything is okay, it subtracts the withdrawal from the balance and shows the new amount.
