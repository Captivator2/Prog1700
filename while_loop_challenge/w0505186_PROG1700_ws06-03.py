# Reflection:
# 1. I found the Number Guesser the most fun because it was like a game.
# 2. A common mistake that caused infinite loops was forgetting to change the counter or stop condition.
# 3. While loops could be used in a real app to repeat asking the user for input until it is correct.
# 4. The Pattern Generator helped me understand loop conditions best because I could see the  number go down each time.
